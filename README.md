Experimental project using [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com), [Meteorite](https://github.com/oortcloud/meteorite) and some [Atmosphere](http://atmosphere.meteor.com) packages.

This project is just my personal concrete application to discover Meteor tool and will be improved day after day. Still in progress, be indulgent! :)

## Requirements

* NodeJS
* NPM
* MongoDB
* [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com) + [Meteorite](https://github.com/oortcloud/)

## Installation

Just clone this repository.

## Usage

`mrt run -p 12345`, where 12345 is your client port.

Let's see the project from your browser : [http://localhost:12345](http://localhost:12345) (adapt with your chosen port).

## Deployment

Soon.
